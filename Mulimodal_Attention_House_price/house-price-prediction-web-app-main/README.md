# House Price Prediction using Text Mining with Neural Network and Gradient Boosting

## Experiments
The code for the experiments mentioned in the paper are in directory "experiments". It includes the web crawler, the data preprocessing, the Grid Search experiments, and the final model development.

# House Price Prediction Web App
This is the Github repo for the house price prediction with description data web application hosted on the Heroku webpage:  
https://house-price-predict-dnn-model.herokuapp.com/  

The word2vec model is too big, so it is in the Google Drive

Download the w2v.model and put it in folder /models  

* This web app implements the Deep Neural Network model for the CSI 6900 Graduate Project titled "House Price Prediction using Text Mining with Neural Network and Gradient Boosting" by Hanxiang (Hanson) Zhang, with supervisor Paula Branco at the University of Ottawa.

* The data used in the project is the house listings at Realtor.ca in May 2021 in five major Ontario cities including Ottawa, Toronto, Brampton, Mississauga and Hamilton.
